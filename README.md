# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-Project
Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) Project focuses on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in shallow water dynamics and wave-current interactions using deep learning models in PyTorch and TensorFlow. It combines physics-based models with AI for accurate coastal hydrodynamic predictions
