# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-Project
Project Overview
This repository contains several notebooks implementing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) related to shallow water dynamics, wave speed, and current speed. The PINNs framework combines physics knowledge with deep learning models to solve complex problems in oceanography and hydrodynamics. These notebooks focus on the application of PINNs in modeling shallow water equations and wave-current interactions using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
